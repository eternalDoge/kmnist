# Kuzushiji-MNIST Classification

This repository impletments the classification for [Kuzushiji-MNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) in Pytorch with model ResNet & ResMLP.



[Kuzushiji-MNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) is a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale, 70,000 images), provided in the original MNIST format as well as a NumPy format. Since MNIST restricts us to 10 classes, we chose one character to represent each of the 10 rows of Hiragana when creating Kuzushiji-MNIST.
